Style Model 1
------------

*Ascending and descending scales in a five-note group is the most frequently seen in this style, which creates an interesting flavor as in playing on a slide.*

Stepwise motions are greatly preferred in cantus firmus style. This Style Model is characterized with successive stepwise motions in the same direction, which appears at least four times to form a five-note group.

Style Model 2
------------

*More daring with larger disjunct (over fourth), some beautiful combinations would be created. It is especially interesting with a downward progression of the fourth at the beginning.*

In this model the cantus firmi are featured with at least one leap in interval of octave and two leaps in intervals greater than thirds.
